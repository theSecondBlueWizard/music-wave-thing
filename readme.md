# music-wave-thing

I've wanted to have a buzzy version of the wall-e intro song (Sunday Clothes, technically from Hello Dolly) as my ringtone for a while, and while it'd probably be easier to transcribe it in garage band or musescore and get it directly, I felt it may be fun to try in python, maybe learn a thing or two about sound encoding while I'm at it

I doubt this will be useful to anyone, but maybe someone gets some use out of this thing, who knows?
