# Sheet music file structure:
At the moment I just wanted to get something going - this was written to be as quick and dirty as possible. Every note is on a single line. This must include the note and octave, as well as the number of beats (as a float).

The BMP would be nice to set in the file itself, but oh well, that's a task for later. Would also be cool to have a tempo flag...
